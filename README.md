# Task-Tracker-Web-App
A Task Tracker web app is a productivity tool designed to help individuals or teams organize, monitor, and manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, update, prioritize, and categorize tasks, set deadlines, and track progress in real time through an intuitive interface. By centralizing task management in one platform, the app improves planning, accountability, and workflow visibility, making it easier to stay focused and meet goals.
## PHASE 1 — Project Setup

Goal: Get a running backend skeleton.

Create project folder and open it in VS Code

Initialize Node.js : npm init -y
Install core dependencies : npm install express dotenv
npm install --save-dev nodemon
Create the folder structure (src, routes, controllers, etc.)
Create server.js
Add npm scripts: "start": "node server.js",
"dev": "nodemon server.js"
Result: Empty server ready to run.
